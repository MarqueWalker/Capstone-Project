# Capstone-Project


# Project Overview:
Walker Marque is tasked with designing a solution using Amazon Web Services (AWS) to separate different parts of their application (like the front-end, back-end, and database) and to host both the application and data analysis in the cloud. They also need to ensure that the system stays up and running even if there are technical issues, unlike their current setup which can go down during power outages.


# Customer Requirements:

1. Separate different parts of the application.
2. Host both application and data analysis in the cloud.
3. Ensure the system stays operational even during technical problems.
